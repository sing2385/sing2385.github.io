       Hi, my name is Deepanshu Singh. I am an aspiring UX designer and cinematographer with a strong passion for creating meaningful user experiences and compelling visual stories. I chose this program because it offers the perfect blend of design, coding, and filmmaking three areas that truly inspire me and align with my creative and technical interests.

        To feel connected with myself, I often watch sunsets while sitting by the shore. Sometimes, I enjoy going on short solo trips to lookout spots in Gatineau Park. When I’m unable to travel, I try to learn new camera or filmmaking techniques at home by experimenting with DIY setups.
